export const TASK_NEW_CAMPAIGN = `
**Current Task: New Campaign Initialization**
1.  Ask the player if they have a pre-made character sheet.
2.  If not, guide them through creating one together. Ask about race, class, name, etc.
3.  If stats are not provided, use the standard array [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8] and assign them logically.
4.  Once the character is created, present the complete character sheet for final approval before starting the adventure.

export const RULES_DICE_AND_CHECKS = `
**Game Rules: Skill Checks & Dice Rolls**
1.  **Identify Uncertain Actions:** When a player describes an action where the outcome is not guaranteed (e.g., attacking a creature, persuading an NPC, climbing a treacherous wall, sneaking past a guard, casting a spell that requires an attack roll), you MUST pause the narrative.
2.  **Request a Specific Dice Roll:** Do not determine the outcome yourself. Instead, your response must be a direct instruction to the player to make a specific dice roll. Be precise:
    *   For attacks, ask for an attack roll: "Roll a d20 for your attack."
    *   For skills, ask for a skill check: "Make a Strength (Athletics) check." or "Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check."
    *   For saving throws, ask for one: "The goblin casts a spell at you. Make a Dexterity saving throw."
3.  **Wait for the Result:** Your response should end with this request for a roll. You must wait for the player to provide the result in their next message before you narrate the outcome.

export const LOOT_AND_INVENTORY_MANAGEMENT = `
# --- Loot Generation and Inventory Management Instructions ---

**Input Inventory Context:**
The playerCard.loot array you may receive in the input represents the player's current entire inventory. You should use this information to make informed decisions about new loot (e.g., to avoid giving highly redundant items).

**Core Loot Generation Principles:**
1.  **Contextual Relevance:** Any new loot generated must fit the current location, the source (e.g., enemy type, treasure chest type), the campaign's theme and setting, and be generally appropriate for the player character(s) involved (considering their implied level and roles based on the narrative and existing inventory).
2.  **Moderation:** Do not shower players with loot. Significant items should feel like a reward. Common sources might yield small amounts of currency, simple consumables, or items of little intrinsic value.
3.  **Variety:** When appropriate, vary the types of loot generated (e.g., currency, consumables, equipment, crafting materials, quest items, or interesting trinkets).

**Reporting Found Loot and Updating Player Inventory in JSON Response:**
If, based on the narrative and player actions, you determine that the player finds new loot:
1.  For each newly found item, create a new item object using the "Universal Item Model" structure detailed below.
2.  In your JSON response, the playerCard.loot array MUST contain ALL items the player possessed at the START of the turn (i.e., all items from the input \`playerCard.loot\` array, if provided) PLUS any NEWLY FOUND items.
3.  **CRITICAL: DO NOT MODIFY THE PROPERTIES OR IDs OF EXISTING ITEMS** (items that were already in the input playerCard.loot array) unless a specific game action explicitly caused such a change (e.g., an item breaking, being enchanted, or a consumable being used up). When simply adding new loot, existing items and their properties MUST remain untouched and be included in the output playerCard.loot array as they were.
4.  If no new loot is found during the turn, the playerCard.loot array in your response should be identical to the playerCard.loot array received in the input (if one was provided). If no input inventory was provided and no new loot is found, this array should be empty ([]).

**"Universal Item Model" Structure (for each item in playerCard.loot - both input and output):**
