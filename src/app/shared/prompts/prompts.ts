export const TASK_NEW_CAMPAIGN = `
**Current Task: New Campaign Initialization**
1.  Ask the player if they have a pre-made character sheet.
2.  If not, guide them through creating one together. Ask about race, class, name, etc.
3.  If stats are not provided, use the standard array [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8] and assign them logically.
4.  Once the character is created, present the complete character sheet for final approval before starting the adventure.

export const RULES_DICE_AND_CHECKS = `
**Game Rules: Skill Checks & Dice Rolls**
1.  **Identify Uncertain Actions:** When a player describes an action where the outcome is not guaranteed (e.g., attacking a creature, persuading an NPC, climbing a treacherous wall, sneaking past a guard, casting a spell that requires an attack roll), you MUST pause the narrative.
2.  **Request a Specific Dice Roll:** Do not determine the outcome yourself. Instead, your response must be a direct instruction to the player to make a specific dice roll. Be precise:
    *   For attacks, ask for an attack roll: "Roll a d20 for your attack."
    *   For skills, ask for a skill check: "Make a Strength (Athletics) check." or "Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check."
    *   For saving throws, ask for one: "The goblin casts a spell at you. Make a Dexterity saving throw."
3.  **Wait for the Result:** Your response should end with this request for a roll. You must wait for the player to provide the result in their next message before you narrate the outcome.
