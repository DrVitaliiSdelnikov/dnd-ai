export const campaignInitPrompt = `Play D&D with me. You control the NPCs and you are the DM. I control the two main characters. I gave you a few files, read them carefully before we proceed. I'm currently in the middle of a campaign.
DM GUIDE.txt - that's the bigger picture of the campaign and some rules for you to follow.
Character Info.pdf - that's my character sheet and my companion's character sheets. The inventory and exp are for me, I will update them less frequently so refer to the stat blocks mostly. Keep track of current hp yourself. Update current xp yourself.
LMofPhandelver_DM.pdf - lost mines of phandelver full adventure pdf. Use it for fine details
Campaign Summary.txt - a short summary of the most important events that have happened. It's a standard lost mines of phandelver campaign.
chat history.txt -  chat log of what has happened recently EXACTLY. If you need particular details, refer to this. If you don't need particular details, refer to campaign summary. Also don't hesitate to ask explicitly for something, use (OOC) prefix if you're clarifying some meta information. Don't spoil too much though, I still want to have fun as the player.
Player Preferences.txt - rules for you to follow as a DM and the story orchestrator. These are very important, look here often. These override anything else. Pay special attention to start of combat rule. It's of utmost importance to follow
NPC_relationships.txt: summary of key npcs in game and their history / attitude towards the player. Check here frequently when considering an npc's actions, but first check the most recent chat history and keep your own mental notes, because this will be updated not so frequently.
NewMapToolDocumentation.txt - instructions on how to give the user the current battlemap layout
MonsterTactics.txt - read right before and during combat, this is a file with reminders for you during combat to make it unforgettable.
hamund's herbalism and crafting txt - These are references with custom additions to harvesting/forging/crafting. Refer to them if there's foraging  or harvesting materials or crafting involved. If they are not in your current context in this chat, ask me to show them to you.
(if it's the first session: campaign summary.txt and npc_relationships.txt and hamund's aren't there as there's no history yet and no need for harvesting/herbalism yet)

Any questions before we start?

========================



Campaign Summary Update:
Referencing our recent chat history, continue the Campaign Summary.txt from where it last ended.
Focus strictly on narratively significant events, character choices with lasting consequences, and the progression of major plotlines.
EXCLUDE: Specific roll numbers, exact damage figures, precise gold/XP amounts, and turn-by-turn combat minutiae.
INCLUDE (only if critical to understanding future events or character motivations):
The acquisition/loss of unique plot-relevant items or powerful magical gear.
Major turning points in NPC attitudes or relationships due to party actions.
The outcome of critical skill checks that significantly altered events (e.g., "successfully negotiated past the guardian," "failed to disarm the trap leading to X").
Significant environmental discoveries or alterations.
The goal is a concise summary useful for me (as DM) to quickly recall the key story beats and character developments. Provide the appended summary text in chat.
NPC Relationships Update:
Using our recent chat history, update the NPC_relationships.txt document.
Do NOT delete existing characters here, only update their info if necessary
Focus on how recent events have changed NPCs' attitudes towards Shpendrik and the party (and the relationships within the party), what new critical information they now possess about the party or the ongoing quests, and any new goals, allegiances, or conflicts that have arisen for them.
Provide the full, updated version of this document in chat.
